# Sequential Bayesian Learning
## Author: Robert Tjarko Lange, Miro Grundei, Sam Gjisem
## Date: November 2018

Repository implements different Sequential Bayesian Learning Agents which parse a binary sequence. The binary sequence was previously generated by a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model.
As the agent parses the individual elements of the sequence she updates her posterior and calculates surprisal measures (Predictive, Bayesian and Confidence-Corrected):

The agents include the following:

* Beta-Bernoulli (BB) agent
* Gaussian Random Walk (GRW) agent
* Gaussian Hierarchical Filter (GHF) agent

The models include the following:

* [x] BB agent modeling the stimulus probability (SP)
* [x] BB agent modeling the alternation probability (AP)
* [x] BB agent modeling the transition probability (TP)
* [x] GRW agent modeling the stimulus probability (SP)
* [x] GRW agent modeling the alternation probability (AP)

TODO:

* [ ] GRW agent modeling the transition probability (TP)
* [ ] GHF agent modeling the stimulus probability (SP)
* [ ] GHF agent modeling the alternation probability (AP)
* [ ] GHF agent modeling the transition probability (TP)
* [ ] Change generation process to include 2nd order Markovity and catch trials
* [ ] Add passing of input file in hhmm_seq_gen format
* [ ] Clean up visualization pipeline

## How to use this code
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/RobertTLange/SequentialBayesianLearning && cd SequentialBayesianLearning
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
```
virtualenv -p python SBL
```
Activate the env (the following command works on Linux, other operating systems might differ):
```
source SBL/bin/activate
```
3. Install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4a. Sample a sequence from the Hierarchical HMM
```
pythonw hhmm_seq_gen.py -t 1st_5_01_5_10_200 -obs_change 0.10 0.90 0.90 0.10
pythonw hhmm_seq_gen.py -t 1st_5_01_5_25_200 -obs_change 0.25 0.75 0.75 0.25
pythonw hhmm_seq_gen.py -t 1st_5_01_5_40_200 -obs_change 0.40 0.60 0.60 0.40
```

4b. Run the different sequential learning agents:
```
python sbl_bb.py -file first_5_01_5_25_200 -S -model AP
```

* Arguments to all sbl_*.py files:
    * -S: to save the results in a txt file
    * -T: run a few tests to check if module is working

                        help='Exponentially weighting parameter for memory/posterior updating')
    parser.add_argument('-model', '--model', action="store", default="SP", type=str,
                        help='Beta-Bernoulli Probability Model (SP, AP, TP)')
